![alt text](https://github.com/andynik/knu_labs/blob/master/blablabot/images/bbb_cover.PNG 'Joker')

This is Discord bot which could set up your profile (name, age, city), say what is on the photo you uploaded to the chat and guide you through some FAQ-page.

Requirements for the project:
- Set up discord bot ([instruction for that](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/make-discord-bot-python), go straight to the video tutorial)
- Set up Cloud Vision API ([that's how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3JVwFmb_BnSLFyVThMfEavAEZYHBpWEd))
- Set up Dialogflow agent and Python client ([the guide](https://medium.com/swlh/working-with-dialogflow-using-python-client-cb2196d579a4))
- Set up Knowledge Connector ([steps for that](https://chatbotslife.com/deconstructing-chatbots-how-to-create-faq-chatbot-with-dialogflow-5d265d8028df))
- Python libs: `discord.py`, `google.cloud`, `dialogflow` and `pandas`
