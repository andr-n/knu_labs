This is Discord bot which could set up your profile (name, age, city) and say what is on the photo you uploaded to the chat.

Requirements for the project:
- Set up discord bot ([video instruction for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNA7Eij3UmY&feature=emb_logo), go straight to the video tutorial)
- Set up Cloud Vision API ([how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3JVwFmb_BnSLFyVThMfEavAEZYHBpWEd))
- Python libs: `discord.py`, `google.cloud` and `pandas`
